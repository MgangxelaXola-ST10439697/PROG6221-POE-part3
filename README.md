The Cybersecurity Chatbot is an interactive C# Windows Forms and Console-based application designed to educate, assist, and support users in adopting safe cybersecurity practices. It simulates a helpful assistant that can respond to cybersecurity-related queries, manage tasks and reminders, quiz users on security topics, and maintain an activity log of user interactions.

This project integrates both graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and console interaction, providing a well-rounded experience for users with different preferences. It combines basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) simulation using string matching with educational features, making cybersecurity approachable and interactive.
The purpose of this project is to:

-Raise cybersecurity awareness by allowing users to ask questions and receive clear, informative answers.

-Help users stay organized with a built-in Task Assistant that allows task creation, reminders, and task tracking via a user-friendly GUI.

-Educate users through an engaging Cybersecurity Quiz game that tests their knowledge of digital threats and safety practices.

-Simulate natural conversation using simple NLP techniques that make the chatbot feel responsive to varied user inputs.

-Track activity history so users can see a log of interactions and features used during their session.

Ultimately, this chatbot aims to simplify complex cybersecurity concepts, promote better security habits, and provide an interactive learning and productivity tool for users of all skill levels.
