Project Overview
Cybersecurity Chatbot is a Windows Forms application designed to promote cybersecurity awareness through a friendly and interactive user interface. Built using C#, the application simulates a chatbot that provides security advice, manages user tasks with reminders, offers a cybersecurity quiz, and keeps track of user interactions in an activity log.
The system is tailored for students and beginners who want to learn cybersecurity concepts while exploring practical software development techniques, such as file handling, exception logging, and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) simulation.
Purpose of the Project
The purpose of this project is to:
•	 Educate Users: Offer simplified explanations of common cybersecurity topics like phishing, password safety, two-factor authentication, etc.
•	 Test Knowledge: Provide a quiz feature to help users assess and reinforce their cybersecurity understanding.
•	 Promote Good Habits: Let users create and manage personal tasks (e.g., "Update my antivirus"), encouraging responsible online behaviour.
•	 Track Activity: Maintain a session-based activity log for transparency and usability feedback.
•	 Simulate NLP: Allow users to interact with the chatbot using natural language-like variations, enhancing usability through NLP-style pattern recognition.
•	Showcase Practical Skills: Demonstrate Windows Forms development, C# logic, error handling, file storage (JSON), and UI design in a real-world educational tool.
